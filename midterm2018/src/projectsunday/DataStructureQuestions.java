	Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

		why do we need data structure? Data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently
		A.
		What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures? Operations on Data Structures. The basic operations that are performed on data structures are as follows: Insertion: Insertion means addition of a new data element in a data structure. Deletion: Deletion means removal of a data element from a data structure if it is found
		List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?Compiler Design,Operating System,Database Management System, Statistical analysis package,Numerical Analysis,Graphics,Artificial Intelligence,Simulation
		what is an Array? An array, in the context of Java, is a dynamically created object that serves as a container to hold constant number of values of the same type
		what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?  First and Major difference between Array and ArrayList in Java is that Array is a fixed length data structure while ArrayList is a variable length Collection class
		what is LinkedList? Java LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements
		How is an Array different from Linked List? In array, each element is independent and can be accessed using it's index value. In case of a linked list, each node/element points to the next, previous, or maybe both nodes
		what is queue? Java Queue is an interface available in java.util package and extends java.util.Collection interface
		what is stack?Java Stack memory is used for execution of a thread
		what is FIFO and LIFO? Java collection framework provides different implementations of Queue, there are queues which order elements in first in first out(FIFO), last in first out (LIFO), in natural order or using the provided comparator
		what is the order of complexity? This means that it is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input, and the algorithm finishes between two factors of it
		what is the best case to search an element from an array? Heap sort Smooth sort	
		what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
		what is tree in data structure? A tree is a nonlinear data structure
		what is graph in data structure? A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges
		what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?  Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not
		What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
		How HashMap works in java? HashMap in Java works on hashing principle. It is a data structure which allows us to store object and retrieve it in constant time O(1) provided we know the key
				
		What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs? java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that we are trying to access array element with an illegal index
		What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?  Manually Arrays.copyOf() 3. System.arraycopy() 4. Object.clone()

		What is difference between an array and a linked list? Difference between Array and Linked List? Basically, an array is a set of similar data objects stored in sequential memory locations under a common heading or a variable name
		What is DFS and BFS?DFS is a recursive algorithm whereas BFS is an iterative one and is implemented using a queue
		What is Recursion? Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method calls itself to solve some problem
		What are linear and non linear data Structures? Linear data structure: A linear data structure traverses the data elements sequentially, in which only one data element can directly be reached
		What is Big-(O)-notation? A beginner's guide to Big O notation. Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm 
		Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity? Bubble Sort Insertion Sort	Heap Sort	

		Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
		
		
		  a)In terms of Accessing element.
		  b)In terms of Inserting element.
		  c)In terms of Searching element.
		  d)In terms of Removing element.
